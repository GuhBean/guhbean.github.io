          Tinah, you were my very first friend when I came back to Canada for university, and I will always treasure that. I still think about our little first year adventures and how excited we were to explore campus and find fun things to do together. Our pho and dumpling dates, just talking and laughing, will forever hold such a special place in my heart.

          You made Kitchener feel like home to me, and I will always be grateful for that. I will forever love you for introducing me to Jash, Caleb, Liz, Gavin, and your family. Every connection you shared with me meant so much.

          You ALSO already know you are fine as hell, but you are also incredibly smart and so genuinely caring. I am so happy that you are surrounded by people who love you as much as I do.
