        <div class="bubble bubble-green">who am i to you?</div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          there isnt exactly a word or label for the kind of person you are to me, and i think theres nothing wrong with that
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          if anything, it shows how special you are to me that i cant group you into the same social category as other people i know
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          the people that mean the most to us are usually the hardest to describe. words like 'friendly' or 'funny' or 'thoughful' start to feel shallow, because there are so many people they could apply to, and they dont really capture what it means to know someone over time
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          for starters, one thing u represent to me is familiarity
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          someone i've known for a while
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          someone i feel safe being myself around, even if that comes with ur typical tinah verbal (more recently sometimes physical) attacks
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          it's easy to say we know each other very well, but i dont think it's that simple. there are still so many things about myself that im not even certain about, so how could i claim to fully understand another person?
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          what feels more true is that i've witnessed you evolve and grow over time. i may not have lived through the exact same experiences as you, but i've watched u move through different phases of your life, from elementary school, highschool, up to everything you're navigating right now
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          genuinely that's what feels really special to me
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          not that we stayed the same, but that we both changed and somehow remained ourselves at the same time
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          another thing you represent to me is determination. i've seen you put real effort into the things you genuinely care about. i've seen the drive you have when you set your mind to something, and i look up to you for that.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          you are a brave and strong person. through all the challenges you've described from ur upbringing, and the ones you face now, whether they're interpersonal, financial, or emotional, you keep going. 
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          if i were placed in the same situations you've been in, i honestly dont know how i would react. you are actually one of the strongest people i know in that sense
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          you also helped me realize that people are not just a means to an end. when i asked "who is tinah to you?", i wasnt even asking what you provide in my life. i wasnt asking what you give me or what role you play. i was asking who you represent. i see you as the end, not just as a someone that brings X emotion or does Y thing for me
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          so sometimes i see is someone driven, brave, and strong. lowk simple words like i mentioned before, but they are definitely earned ones.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          ur someone i can cleanly argue with too
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          u represent a different kind of view in my life, and i value that a lot
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          a lot of the people im close to are similar to be in background, perspective, and comfort. YOU arent
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          you challenge me, and i dont mean that negatively. i enjoy talking to you about things i care about, especially when you disagree. you force me to think more honestly and clearly
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          affectionately, ur someone i can safely be myself around. you taught me not to be afraid of nerding out and being who i really am. thats a gift you've given me, whether u realized it or not
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          you unapologetically enjoy what you enjoy, from ur horror games to ur favorite kpop groups to the little things that make you, you. i find that very refreshing. it's rare and every conversation i have with you, albeit ones that dont involve your aggressive teasing, is always so genuine because of that. you dont have to hide anything about yourself to the people you're close with, and i think thats a really special thing to be able to do with someone
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          you're also someone i genuinely like making things for
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          a lot of the things i've created trace back to you in some way, because you actually appreciate them
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          from the annoying lamp bot to your lighter to your birthday website, you always show so much appreciation for the things i make for you, and that means a lot to me. it makes me feel like the effort i put into making things for you is worth it.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          you make me feel capable of showing love in a way that feels natural to me. i like your reassurance more than i can explain

      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          in my life, you represent someone who brings out the best in me

          you push me outside my comfort zone

      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          most of the time, if you asked me to do something, i would give it everything i have. not because i feel obligated, but because i care about you
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          the question was never "who is tinah?", but "who is tinah to me?"

          i hope that hearing from the people around you helps you see some of those fragments together

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          to me, you are somone familiar, someone who understands me, someone who challenges me, and someone who pushes me to be better simply by being yourself

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
