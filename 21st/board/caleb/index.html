          I have no idea where she came from. As far as I'm concerned, Tinah just appeared in my life one day, and has remained ever since.

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          For all the highs and lows in my life, I'm glad she's remained as one of my closest friends.

          Sure, we've fought. Heck, we've been at each other's throats for years.

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          But even though we've pushed each other to our very limits, Tinah is without a doubt the most reliable friend I have.

          I swear she does things for the sole purpose of pissing me off.

          It drives me nuts.

          And yet, I know for a fact that if I need something, she's always ready and willing to help.

          She's the most supportive person I know, and easily one of my best friends.

          Despite everything, I'd trust her with my life.

          I look up to her, admire her, and I'm so so proud of her.

          So yeah, I find her absolutely irritating, and I love her to bits.

          After all, she's a childhood friend, and I sure hope we stay that way.
