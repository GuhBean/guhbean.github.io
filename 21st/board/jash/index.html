          I can't just come up with one word to describe who tinah is to me but she is my soulmate, my best friend, my day one, my constant, my ride or die, and my twin of course!

          I find it so crazy how we basically witnessed each other grow up and go through every single phase together. Examples include: reading her crazily intense fanfics about kpop boys, dream smp obsession, “glitch” era, having multiple pronouns, seeing our favourite kpop groups live for the first time, and many more that I can't list :D

          She's so selfless and puts others first, and one of the times I'll never forget is when she came down to see me right after her exam just because I was heartbroken :(

          I may not express it often, but I appreciate her so much more than she thinks. She doesn't even realize how she's literally the light in so many peoples' lives. I've genuinely never met anymore more caring and thoughtful.

          Like honestly I probably wouldn't even survive if I didn't have her in my life lol :3

          The world is so full of temporary things and people, but I truly believe that she's gonna be in my life forever.

          We may have had our ups and downs and times where we completely stopped talking to each other, but I think these particular moments are what have made our friendship last so long, I mean almost 10 years?!? Like wow we spent our teens together, now we're gonna spend our twenties together too (and the rest of our lives)!!

          I find it so funny because when I first came to Canada, she was the first person to talk to me and I remember how I got annoyed by how often she interacted with me LMAO but little did I know this girl was my literal soulmate :')
