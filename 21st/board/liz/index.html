          Tinah has been my day 1 from all those years ago, waaaaay back in our Sweeney days, damn near 8 years. She was the first person that I came out to and shes been my rock since.

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          She is such a supportive friend who will not only have my back but will also keep it real with me which I appreciate a whole ton.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          She's always willing to hear me out on my lows and even calls me silly for some of the things I think about which she is right about for most of the time.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          She often checks in with me every now and then, even if things are ok. When things aren't the greatest she'll give me the floor and listen and give advice or even relate to what I say and we bond over it.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          It's something I'll always appreciate and she's someone I still don't quite think I deserve, I can already hear her calling me silly for saying that.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          She is very appreciative of her friends and can bring people together for a great time. It's something I've always admired about her.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          She is also funny and quick witted and she is hella expressive with her face, all of which I adore.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          On the other end, she's considerate of everyone, always putting them at the forefront of her mind even if she bullies them a ton.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          She cares a lot, has so much love to give and share, and spreads kindness to me and many others.

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          Sometimes she'll disagree with all of that, saying shes does the opposite. And to that I say she is a bit silly for thinking that :>
        </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          I love our girl talk, our banter, our game nights and even when we just mess around, it's something I will forever cherish.

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          She goes to great lengths for me to make me feel comfortable. Be it make up or clothing, scents or skin care advice, she doesn't have to do all of that but she does anyways and I can't thank her enough.

      </div>

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          I can actually be a woman around her which is something I can't say of just anyone.

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
        <div class="bubble bubble-gray">
          All of this to say, to my rock, my bestie, my girlie, happy 21st birthday!

      <div class="bubble-row incoming">
