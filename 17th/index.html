      <h3>
        but i never actually had anything prepared. <br />
        there was <strong>nothing</strong> past the gift box because it took too
        long to finish.
        <br />
        i hope you're ok with this tho. <br />
        i really tried to get it done in time, but i
        <strong>completey forgot</strong> about you
      </h3>
      <h3>
        but yeah if only there was something prepared for me to give you.
        <br />
        oh and <strong>don't mind</strong> the password whatever. <br />
