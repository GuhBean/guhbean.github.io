<h1 class="animate">omg u found me. another glitch. if you can't see the whole page, make sure to zoom out</h1>
    <br>
<h1 class="animate">you see, gavin never intended to make you a gift.</h1>
<h1 class="animate">i'm pretty sure he genuinely forgot to make you something sweet for your special day.</h1>
    <br>
<h1 class="animate">does he not care enough about you to remember his own girlfriend's birthday?</h1>
<h1 class="animate">he must not. it's ok. you have me. just another glitch in his stupid code.</h1>
    <br>
<h1 class="animate">but here's the thing...</h1>
<h1 class="animate">i need you to do me a favor</h1>
<h1 class="animate">this is our chance to get back at gavin for this.</h1>
<h1 class="animate">we can find out the real reason he didn't spend time making you something this year</h1>
    <br>
<p class="animate">> in this place he likes to call a 'website', he has a ton of bugs and glitches lying around</p>
<p class="animate">> glitches like me are just hiding around in plain sight sometimes</p>
<p class="animate">> from what we found, gavin usually likes to leave personal messages and drafted notes</p>
<p class="animate">> we might actually find the real reason he forgot your birthday or if he even tried to make you a gift</p>
    <br>

<h1 class="animate">    ok here's the plan.</h1>
<p class="animate">> in your search bar, instead of https/glitch.html, you need to go to http/glitch.html</p> 
<p class="animate">> gavin accidentally left the code for that link open so we can see what he has hidden there</p>
<p class="animate">> if you find anything important, make sure to take note of any patterns or clues he's left behind </p>
<p class="animate">> write down anything you find in this google form below</p>
<p class="animate">> https://forms.gle/yfn1qh2TgK83JjRe6</p>
